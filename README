This script copies an edited Obsidian theme.css file
as well as relevant appearance and hotkey settings
from a .obsidian "vault" folder to a "master" folder.

It then copies these files to all Obsidian vaults.

Tested on macOS Monterey and Obsidian 1.2.7

FROM THE MOST RECENTLY EDITED .obsidian folder
(located inside your vault).
